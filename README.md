SVM CLassification Algorithm

Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

Summary:

In this project we are going to train a model that predicts whether person has diabetes or not by using support vector machine algorithm.
